We believe you shouldn't need a chemistry degree to understand your supplements - every ingredient comes from a single farm we can name, in packaging that goes back to the earth. It's wellness that's good for you and good for the planet.",
    "brandStory": "GreenLeaf Organics was born from a frustrating search for supplements my pregnant wife could trust. As I dug into the wellness industry, I was shocked by the lack of transparency, synthetic ingredients marketed as 'natural,' and the disconnect between products and their supposed organic sources. After visiting a family-owned organic farm in Vermont and tasting the difference real, fresh superfoods could make, I knew there was a better way. We started with one product - a simple organic spirulina blend from that Vermont farm - and a promise: complete transparency, genuinely sustainable practices, and direct farmer partnerships. Five years later, we work with 150+ organic farms across the Americas, we've helped over 50,000 families simplify their wellness routines, and we've invested $2M back into regenerative agriculture education. But our mission hasn't changed: make organic, sustainable wellness simple, transparent, and accessible."
